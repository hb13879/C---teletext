Testing

This file details the testing I carried out on my teletext code. 3 distinct approaches to testing were used.
All three methods were dynamic, meaning that code was actually executed in order to test. Static testing,
that is reviewing the code, was also carried out but I will not discuss this in detail here.

The first form of dynamic testing was unit level testing. This means testing each function is operating
correctly independently of the wider system. This is performed inside the teletext_testing.c file. More
details can be found in the unit testing section below.
The second type of testing I carried out was destructive testing. This means testing using code designed
to cause the program to crash. Again, more details can be found below. Thirdly, system testing was carried out using the .m7
files test.m7, panda.m7 and lfc.m7. These outputs were compared to the gifs provided in the question to provide validation
that the code was working correctly.

Unit testing

In this section I will give more detail about unit tests. I will refer to the file teletext_testing.c. The first function
tests all functions used for initialising or freeing data arrays. The data structure used in the code is parent 'grid'
structure which contains an array of 100 'bytes', each of which has a data value as well as a double height parameter.
The overarching grid also carries parameters relating to graphics, colours, held graphics and letter height. With such
a non trivial data structure, this first test function is vital. One important thing it checks is whether the 2d calloc'ed
array of bytes is allocated correctly, as well as whether it is freed correctly. The freeing of this data array was one
bug that this test function revealed: the grid->data pointer was not left as NULL after freeing the underlying array at
first. This was solved by passing in a pointer to the start of the 2d array (a byte***) so that the byte** could be
altered from within the function. If this bug had not been caught the code would have been left with a pointer to the
old array, which will remain in the same place in memory until it is overwritten. Leaving this pointer as this value
leaves the risk of that pointer being followed later in the code, perhaps leading to unexpected/undefined behaviour
if not caught by the compiler.
Another issue this first function examines is the use of the colour struct. The grid parent structure contains colour
pointers for the background and foreground colours. It is therefore also necessary to check that these are initialised and
freed correctly.
All in all, this function is so important because initialising a data structure with so many components is likely to
lead to problems if not tested robustly.
The other functions in this file systematically test the other functions in teletext.c. I will only focus on a few details
here however.
On a couple of occasions for loops are used to test whether colours are set correctly and as expected. This makes use
of the data structure colour, which contains a 'red', 'green' and 'blue' integer. It also makes use of the enumerated type
'shade'. This enumeration, together with an auxiliary function that tests whether a colour is indeed the shade it
is meant to be, allows a for loop to be used to cycle through all the available colours to test whether they have
been set as intended.
Another important unit testing function which revealed a bug was that testing the newline operations in the main code.
According to the specification, when a new line is reached in the teletext grid, parameters should be reset to default
values. Originally, strange output was being seen when system tests were carried out. It transpired that this was due
to these values not being reset when a newline was reached.

Destructive Testing

5 destructive tests were carried out as follows:

1 & 2: These tested the read_in function and how it dealt with NULL parameters, to test the cases that a NULL data array
or a NULL teletext filename were passed in. This code tests whether or not the code crashes gracefully. It does.

3 & 4: These tests are designed to pass the code teletext files that are not the specified size (in this case 1000 bytes).
As the teletext files passed in make clear on execution, the code still renders either the first 1000 bytes or as
many bytes as exist in this case. The code does not actually crash.

5: The fifth test ensures the code deals correctly with invalid opcodes being passed to it. In this case it again crashes
gracefully.

When typing 'make run' you should see relevant crash messages for each of these in turn, before information on the unit
tests at the end.

System Testing

As mentioned, the code was tested using the .m7 files porvided and comparing the outputs with their respective gifs.
