My extension is an authoring tool, parsed by a recursive descent parser. It allows the user to type basic commands,
for example "BACKGROUND:RED","GRAPHICS:CONTIGIOUS","HOLD" or DATA:"Hello, World". A text file containing these
commands (authoring_tool.txt) is parsed by the code in rdp.c. This outputs a .m7 file which is then passed into
teletext.c, and renders the file to the screen.

The grammar the recursive descent parser uses is as follows, written in Backus-Naur Form. To summarise, there are
2 types of valid command: an assignment, where a parameter value is set, and data input, where asci characters or
graphics codes are input. A new line can be input using ; or by pressing enter. The easiest way to use the tool is
to write code in 25 lines, with code relating to a given line appearing on that line. An example file is created and
is rendered when the make run command is executed.

ASSIGNMENT  ::= COLPARAM COLON COLOUR | GRAPHMD COLON GRAPHMDPARAM | HEIGHT COLON HEIGHTMD
INPUTDATA   ::= DATA COLON SPEECH DATAVALUE SPEECH
DATAVALUE   ::= [ -~]+
COLPARAM    ::= "BACKGROUND" | "FOREGROUND" | "GRAPHICS"
COLOUR      ::= "RED" | "GREEN" | "YELLOW" | "BLUE" | "MAGENTA" | "CYAN" | "WHITE" | "BLACK"
HEIGHT      ::= "HEIGHT"
HEIGHTMD    ::= "SINGLE" | "DOUBLE"
GRAPHMD     ::= "GRAPHMD"
GRAPHMDPARAM::= "CONTIGIOUS" | "SEPARATE"
COLON       ::= ":"
DATA        ::= "DATA"
SPEECH      ::= """
NEWLINE     ::= ";"
END         ::= "END"

The keyword END can be written if you wish to end your teletext code before the 25th line. This will fill the remainder
with spaces.

There are a couple of areas for future development with this tool, were more time available. For example, the GUI for
this tool could obviously be improved. In addition, a better system for entering graphics could be created. At the moment
the user must enter the character with the correct asci code corresponding to the relevenat graphic as per the tables in
the question. However, the back end of the recursive descent parser provides a good baseline for any such modifications.
